# NFR Test Guide: Performance & Reliability

### 🧠 Deep Research Prompt Required

This guide defines the non-functional testing standards for the Quality Factory.

**Prompt**:

> "Draft an 'NFR (Non-Functional Requirements) Test Guide' for an AI Quality Agent. Include:
>
> 1. Performance Testing (Load, Stress, Scalability, P95 Latency benchmarks).
> 2. Security Testing (Vulnerability scanning, Penetration testing patterns).
> 3. Accessibility Testing (WCAG 2.1 mapping to automated tests).
> 4. Reliability Testing (Chaos engineering, Error recovery, Backup verification).
> 5. Data Integrity Testing (State synchronization across distributed components)."
