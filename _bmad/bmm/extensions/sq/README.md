# SQ (ShipQuick) — Migrated

**Status:** Integrated as primary BMM agents (2026-02-15)

The SQ SAFe 6.0 agents and workflows have been promoted from extension to **primary BMM team**.

## New Locations

- **Agents:** `_bmad/bmm/agents/sq-pm.md`, `sq-rte.md`, `sq-architect.md`, `sq-team.md`
- **Workflows:**
  - `_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/sq-init/`, `sq-analyze/`
  - `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/sq-solve/`, `sq-plan/`
  - `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/sq-exec/`, `sq-audit/`, `sq-export/`
- **Data:** `_bmad/bmm/data/safe-types.yaml`

## Why

The SAFe agents replace the default BMAD agents (pm, architect, sm, dev, qa) as the primary team for this project. They are no longer an extension — they are the core.
